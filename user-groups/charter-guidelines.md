# OpenSearch Project User Groups

User Groups are community-driven meetups, or recurring gatherings who discuss OpenSearch topics, share knowledge, present related solutions, and network with the wider open source community. 

## Charter

OpenSearch Project User Groups are meant to facilitate in-person collaboration, knowledge sharing, success stories, best practices, and resources. OpenSearch User Groups follow a code of conduct that promote an inclusive, respectful, welcoming environment driven by open collaboration. User Groups may be structured differently across the world based on the user group leaderâ€™s style, regional needs, and User Group specific needs.

## Guidelines

* Frequency: Each User Group needs to hold a meetup *minimum* once every 3 months. Consistency is a key to the success. 
* Topics: UG/Meetups over-arching topic should be OpenSearch, and related technologies, open source is always a preferred. The community can deem what of interest during the planning of each meeting.
* Goals: Presentations and talks should be about technology, community, and helping one another grow. User groups are not intended to serve as sales channels. Making contacts is a benefit to organizing, joining, and participating in User Groups, the primary goal is for everyone to participate with the intent of sharing knowledge about the solution and fostering a sense of community.

## Meeting Format

Meetings can vary, but most will have key activities including presentations, discussions, Q&A time, networking, and potentially more hands-on participation when available. A meeting could have a combination of the above, depending on how each organizer and community plans their events out. 

Experience tells us that the best time to host a meeting is after office hours, usually on a weekday. Please work to ensure meetings do not run too late so the participants can travel home safely and get enough rest for the next day. Meetings typically range from 1 to 3 hours, depending on the needs of the local community and how each organizer plans out the event. 

All OpenSearch Project User Group meetings are intended to be free to attend.
